# Data

A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks that progress from foundational to advanced data analysis and machine learning concepts.

This repository is organized as a learning path:
- 1_basic — Essential Python for data work, data wrangling, exploration, and visualization
- 2_advanced — Feature engineering, modeling workflows, evaluation, and more advanced techniques

## Overview
This project is intended for learners and practitioners who want hands-on, runnable examples of core data science workflows. The notebooks emphasize:
- Clean, readable code
- Reproducible analysis
- Clear narratives and visualizations

## Repository Structure
```
.
├── 1_basic/       # Foundational notebooks: Python for data, pandas, EDA, plotting
└── 2_advanced/    # Advanced topics: feature engineering, modeling, pipelines, evaluation
```

Suggested topic ideas for each section (adjust as your content evolves):
- 1_basic:
  - Python refresher for data
  - Pandas: loading, cleaning, merging
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- 2_advanced:
  - Feature engineering and preprocessing
  - Model training with scikit-learn
  - Cross-validation and metrics
  - Model interpretation and error analysis

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.9+ (3.10 recommended)
- One of: pip + venv or Conda
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook

If the repository includes a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` later, prefer those. Otherwise, use one of the setups below.

### Option A: pip + venv
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SHAHRIAR-HOSSAIN-RIMON/Data.git
cd Data

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install common data packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Option B: Conda
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SHAHRIAR-HOSSAIN-RIMON/Data.git
cd Data

# Create and activate an environment
conda create -n data-env python=3.10 -y
conda activate data-env

# Install common data packages
conda install -y jupyterlab numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Notebooks
```bash
# From the repository root
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```
Then open notebooks under `1_basic` or `2_advanced`.

Tips:
- If a notebook expects a dataset, check its first cells for download instructions or file paths.
- Restart the kernel and run all cells if you encounter import/state issues.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome!
- Keep notebooks clean: remove unnecessary outputs, but preserve essential visuals/results.
- Use clear markdown cells to explain your steps and decisions.
- Prefer reproducible data access (e.g., programmatic downloads) when possible.

Proposed workflow:
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b topic/add-eda-notebook`
2. Add or update notebooks under the appropriate folder
3. Ensure the notebook runs top-to-bottom without errors
4. Commit with a descriptive message and open a pull request

## FAQ
- Q: I’m missing a package import.  
  A: Install it in your active environment, e.g., `pip install <package>` or `conda install <package>`.
- Q: Where should I put datasets?  
  A: If a notebook doesn’t download data automatically, create a local `data/` folder next to the notebook or update paths accordingly.
